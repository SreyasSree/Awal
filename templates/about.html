            Awal Mohamed Trading , is a Bahraini company, working on the design of decor products with different ideas, mixing the spirit with material, depending on a team work with creative vision and innovative design whose sole goal is to transform your room into a creative part in which you feel proud and elegant. Our idea began as an extension of our great Islamic history, which has been known as Islamic architecture since time immemorial, but we have specialized in part of the high - end Islamic decoration which is wall art , not only since we are not only limiting ourselves to Islamic decoration, but is our basic motto Our idea was a huge success in the Bahrain market, and we agreed with the customers' tastes , for that we decided to launch our website.Â Let's share with the world this wonderful experience to enjoy with us the pleasant acquisition of these products and the sense of spirituality that our products bring to the place as soon as they are placed to convey to the person spiritual peace by making elegant murals of modern- day Koranic verses
